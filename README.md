DESCRIPTION

This Live Covid Website has three pages , all of which are linked through 3 buttons at the top . When clicked , the webpage will show the corresponding page. The pages are :-

1. World Data - Displays the global covid data.

2. User Location Data  - This page firstly asks for permission to access user's location. It then displays the latitude , longitude , country , state and district of user. Lastly it displays the covid data of user's state.

3. Search With Province - This page wil have two input bars in which user is required to provide any province and country across the globe . On clicking , the covid data of the province will be displayed.


PROBLEMS FACED

I faced problem in converting the user's coordinates into human readable address . But I solved it using the opencage API which gave the complete json data of user's address.


SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT

The webpage could be made responsive for mobile phones as well.


What I Learned ?

I learnt Javascript syntax , async functions , fetch API via requests , promises and extracting the useful data from the JSON data fetched. I also learnt some animations.
